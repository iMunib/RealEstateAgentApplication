Dear Professor,

The database is 2 tables, one is signup and the other one is users. 
The sql file has the sql for you to deploy everything and to test the application.
We also implemented the search and filter into the search bar where it would filter out the results in li elements.


There is no special coding considerations needed.

There were 3 people in our group and this is what they did. 

Rehman: login.php and logindb.php and connection.php
Neeraj: signup.php, signupdb.php and connection.php
Ayesha: database connection debugging, input testing, css

We are all happy with everyones work and look forward to the demo!

Have a nice day.
